## About the project
Space 2D shooter written as a home project to develop OOP skills. This is my first Pygame project and my first pet project in general. I will be glad if you point out my mistakes or suggest options that will optimize the game process and improve it from an architectural point of view.


## Rules
Your task is to kill the main boss - a flying saucer. If you run into bullets or enemies, you will die. The game has two bonuses that are valid for five seconds:
1. Lightning - increases outgoing damage
2. Star - gives two additional bullets
